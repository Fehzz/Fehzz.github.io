# Fehzz.github.io
#This script is designed to execute tasks remotely, via SSH. 
#Before connecting to the SSH server, it will check for needed applications.
#If they are installed, it will notifty the user accordingly.
#Otherwise, the applications will be installed.

#An anonymity check is done to ensure that the identity of the user is not exposed.
#This will allow the user to safely execute commands such as nmap and whois from the remote server to a target server to obtain necessary information.

#All necessary information must be stored in the local computer, so the script will ensure that it is so.

#The output of the script is colour coded to make it more interactive with the end-user. It is minimal.

#Any feedback is appreciated!
